## 🏗️ Guardrail Levels

### Level 1: Semantic & Structural (Static)
*Focus: Is the system organized correctly?*
- **Constraint**: Every new module must have a corresponding entry in `indices/`.
- **Constraint**: No orphan files in `docs/` (must be indexed).
- **Mechanism**: Index Linting.

### Level 2: Operational & Git (Dynamic)
*Focus: Is the process being followed?*
- **Constraint**: `.sdd-cache.md` must be updated before any commit.
- **Constraint**: `mandate.spec` must pass validation.
- **Mechanism**: [pre-commit](../../../../../tools/scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit) (Git Hooks).

### Level 3: Cognitive & Integrity (Intelligence)
*Focus: Is the reasoning quality high?*
- **Constraint**: Agent must pass the "Two-Question Quiz" before research.
- **Constraint**: READMEs must follow the "Honest Critique" policy.
- **Mechanism**: Decision Models & Quizzes.
