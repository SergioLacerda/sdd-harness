## ✅ Routine Maintenance

### Daily Tasks (15 min)

#### 1. Backup Governance

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as: scripts/daily-backup.sh

BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/daily/sdd-$BACKUP_DATE"

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup critical files
echo "Backing up governance..."
cp -r .sdd-core/CANONICAL "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp -r .sdd-wizard/compiled "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp CHANGELOG.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Record backup
echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_DIR ($(du -sh "$BACKUP_DIR" | cut -f1))"

# Keep only last 30 days
find /backups/daily -name "sdd-*" -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;

echo "✅ Daily backup complete"
```

**Run daily at 01:00:**
```bash
0 1 * * * /home/sergio/scripts/daily-backup.sh >> /var/log/sdd-backup.log 2>&1
```

#### 2. Health Check

```bash
# Already defined in MONITORING.md
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ All artifacts present
# ✅ CLI available
# ✅ Governance valid
# ✅ Disk space OK
```

#### 3. Review Error Logs

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for errors from previous 24 hours

echo "=== Error Log Review ==="

# Application logs
if [ -f "logs/sdd-app.log" ]; then
    ERRORS=$(grep -c "ERROR\|FAIL" logs/sdd-app.log || echo "0")
    echo "Application errors: $ERRORS"
    if [ "$ERRORS" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "Recent errors:"
        grep "ERROR\|FAIL" logs/sdd-app.log | tail -5
    fi
fi

# System logs
if command -v journalctl &> /dev/null; then
    echo ""
    echo "System errors (last 24h):"
    journalctl --since "24 hours ago" -p err | grep -i sdd || echo "  None found"
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ Log review complete"
```

### Weekly Tasks (1 hour)

#### 1. Cleanup Old Files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as: scripts/weekly-cleanup.sh

echo "=== Weekly Cleanup ==="

# Remove old test artifacts

[ $REMOVED -gt 0 ] && echo "  Removed: $REMOVED directories"

# Clean Python cache
echo "Cleaning Python cache..."
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
find . -type d -name ".pytest_cache" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true

echo "  ✅ Logs archived"

# Verify cleanup
TOTAL_SIZE=$(du -sh . | cut -f1)
echo ""
echo "Total workspace size: $TOTAL_SIZE"

echo ""
echo "✅ Weekly cleanup complete"
```

**Run weekly (e.g., Sunday 02:00):**
```bash
0 2 * * 0 /home/sergio/scripts/weekly-cleanup.sh
```

#### 2. Performance Review

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Analyze weekly performance

echo "=== Weekly Performance Review ==="

fi

# Step 4: Restore
echo ""
echo "Step 4: Restoring from backup..."
cd -
rm -rf .sdd-wizard/compiled
