# 📑 Indices Layer — Quick Lookup

**Fast reference templates and indices for all projects**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The indices layer provides template indices that projects copy and customize during PHASE 0 setup. Projects maintain their own copies in `.sdd/context-aware/` for fast, project-specific lookups.

---

## 📂 Available Indices

### 1. Search Keywords Index

**File:** `search-keywords.md`
**Purpose:** Keyword-to-document mapping for on-demand discovery
**Use When:** You know WHAT you're looking for, but not WHERE
**Copy To:** `.sdd/context-aware/search-keywords.md` (project-local)

**Contents:**

- Framework concepts
- Constitutional foundation
- Architecture decisions
- Context-aware patterns
- Implementation standards
- Development workflow
- Emergency procedures
- Reference & glossary

---

### 2. CANONICAL Layer Index

**File:** `spec-canonical-index.md`
**Purpose:** Complete reference to immutable authority layer
**Use When:** Need to understand rules, decisions, and specifications
**Copy To:** `.sdd/context-aware/spec-canonical-index.md` (project-local)

**Contents:**

- Authority hierarchy
- Rules (constitution, mandatory, conventions)
- Architecture decisions (6 ADRs)
- Specifications (how-to guides)
- Quick navigation by need
- Layers below CANONICAL
- Emergency quick links

---

### 3. Guides Layer Index

**File:** `spec-guides-index.md`
**Purpose:** Complete reference to operational guides
**Use When:** Need step-by-step help for specific scenarios
**Copy To:** `.sdd/context-aware/spec-guides-index.md` (project-local)

**Contents:**

- Onboarding guides (9 files)
- Operational guides (5 files)
- Emergency guides (6 files)
- Quick navigation by scenario
- Duration estimates
- Guide relationships
- Quick links by problem

## 🔄 Two-Tier Index System

**Framework Tier (here, docs/indices/):**

- ✅ Templates for all projects
- ✅ Updated quarterly (when framework changes)
- ✅ Canonical reference

**Project Tier (.sdd/context-aware/ in each project):**

- ✅ Project-specific copies
- ✅ Can diverge from framework
- ✅ Updated as needed by projects
- ✅ Fast local reference

**Workflow:**

```
1. Framework provides templates → docs/indices/
2. During setup, templates copied → .sdd/context-aware/
3. Projects customize as needed
4. Each project maintains own indices
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Projects (PHASE 0)

```bash
# Copy indices templates to project-local
cp docs/indices/search-keywords.md .sdd/context-aware/
cp docs/indices/spec-canonical-index.md .sdd/context-aware/
cp docs/indices/spec-guides-index.md .sdd/context-aware/

# Customize for your project (optional)
vi .sdd/context-aware/search-keywords.md
```

### For Existing Projects

```bash
# Verify you have project copies
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/search-keywords.md
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/spec-canonical-index.md
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/spec-guides-index.md

# If missing, copy from framework
cp docs/indices/* .sdd/context-aware/
```

| Index | Primary Use | Size | Update Freq |
|-------|-------------|------|-------------|
| search-keywords.md | Fast keyword lookup | ~100 lines | Quarterly |
| spec-canonical-index.md | Understanding authority | ~150 lines | Quarterly |

## ✅ How Indices Work

### Scenario 1: "Where's the rule about testing?"

```
1. Search keywords.md → "testing"
2. Find: CANONICAL/specifications/definition_of_done.md
3. Read: Testing section
```

### Scenario 2: "How do I add a new project?"

```
1. Search spec-guides-index.md → "Adding new project"
2. Find: guides/operational/ADDING_NEW_PROJECT.md
3. Follow: Step-by-step guide
```

### Scenario 3: "Why is thread isolation mandatory?"

```
1. Search spec-canonical-index.md → "thread isolation"
2. Find: CANONICAL/decisions/ADR-005
3. Read: Architecture decision
```

## 📝 Notes

- These indices are TEMPLATES, not project-local instances
- Each project customizes its own `.sdd/context-aware/` copies
- Framework tier updated quarterly; projects can diverge
- For framework-level questions: use these files
- For project-specific questions: use `.sdd/context-aware/` copies
