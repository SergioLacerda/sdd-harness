## 🔒 Core Governance Kernel

**Location:** `docs/spec/canonical/core/`

### 📋 Mandates (HARD)

Immutable governance rules enforced at runtime.

| Mandate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [M003: Context Awareness](../spec/canonical/core/mandates/M003_CONTEXT_AWARENESS.md) | Maintain `.sdd-cache.md` per project with execution state |
| [M005: Token Economy](../spec/canonical/core/mandates/M005_TOKEN_ECONOMY.md) | Enforce budget zones (GREEN/YELLOW/RED/BREACH) per PATH |
| [M007: Telemetry](../spec/canonical/core/mandates/M007_TELEMETRY.md) | Emit mandatory governance events every session |

### 📌 Policies (IMMUTABLE)

Always-active behavioral policies.

| Policy | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [P001: Project Boundary](../spec/canonical/core/policies/P001_PROJECT_BOUNDARY.md) | Namespace isolation — govern by workspace profile |
| [P002: Honest Critique](../spec/canonical/core/policies/P002_HONEST_CRITIQUE.md) | Truth in labeling, debt-aware reporting |
| [P003: Mandatory Human Review](../spec/canonical/core/policies/P003_MANDATORY_HUMAN_REVIEW.md) | Agents propose, humans dispose — no autonomous git mutations |
| [P004: Pre-Delivery Quality Gate](../spec/canonical/core/policies/P004_PRE_DELIVERY_QUALITY_GATE.md) | Verify tooling present, run mandatory tools, report status |

### 🧠 Cognition Module

Decision engines for task classification, context loading, and anti-pattern avoidance.

**Decision Models:**
- [TASK_CLASSIFICATION.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/decision-models/TASK_CLASSIFICATION.md) — Route task to PATH A–F
- [CONTEXT_SELECTION.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/decision-models/CONTEXT_SELECTION.md) — Select minimal context per task
- [EXECUTION_DECISION.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/decision-models/EXECUTION_DECISION.md) — Deterministic vs Guided vs Exploratory

**Context Loading:**
- [context-budget.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/context-loading/context-budget.md) — Budget targets per PATH
- [path-routing.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/context-loading/path-routing.md) — Full routing table: task → PATH → docs
- [strategy.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/context-loading/strategy.md) — Priority order: Runtime → Canonical → Guides → Reality

**Anti-Patterns:**
- [CONTEXT_IGNORANCE.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/anti-patterns/CONTEXT_IGNORANCE.md) — Loading no runtime context
- [OVERLOADING_CONTEXT.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/anti-patterns/OVERLOADING_CONTEXT.md) — Loading too much, exceeding budget
- [RULE_BYPASS.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/anti-patterns/RULE_BYPASS.md) — Hacking around mandates/policies
- [STATE_DESYNC.md](../spec/canonical/core/cognition/anti-patterns/STATE_DESYNC.md) — Operating on stale state

### 💰 Economy Module

Token and resource budget enforcement.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [efficiency-policy.md](../spec/canonical/core/economy/efficiency-policy.md) | Compression obligations, provider chain, circuit breakers |
| [execution-budget.md](../spec/canonical/core/economy/execution-budget.md) | Hard ceilings per PATH, zone table, re-baselining |
| [metrics.md](../spec/canonical/core/economy/metrics.md) | KPI definitions, telemetry field specs |

### 🔔 Telemetry Module

Compliance and observability events.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [governance-events.md](../spec/canonical/core/telemetry/governance-events.md) | Event schema: drift, violation, policy failure |

### ⚔️ Guardrails Module

Three-level enforcement: Structural (L1), Operational (L2), Cognitive (L3).

- [guardrails/INDEX.md](../spec/canonical/core/guardrails/INDEX.md) — Guardrail levels and enforcement matrix

### 🎯 Rules

Hard style, testing, and structure rules.

| Rule | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [code-style.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/code-style.md) | Code naming and organization |
| [tests.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/tests.md) | Test requirements, F.I.R.S.T principles, mocking rules |
| [dependencies.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/dependencies.md) | Dependency declaration and resolution |
| [structure.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/structure.md) | Module organization and layer boundaries |
| [formatting.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/formatting.md) | Code formatting conventions |
| [logging.md](../spec/canonical/core/rules/logging.md) | Logging standards and patterns |

### 🤖 Generated / Runtime

Compiled execution layer.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [generated/AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.md](../spec/canonical/core/generated/AGENT_ENTRYPOINT.md) | 10-step agent bootstrap and execution kernel |
| [generated/HANDSHAKE.md](../spec/canonical/core/generated/HANDSHAKE.md) | 5-step governance activation handshake |
| [generated/AGENT_RUNTIME_PROTOCOL.md](../spec/canonical/core/generated/AGENT_RUNTIME_PROTOCOL.md) | 5-step execution contract |
