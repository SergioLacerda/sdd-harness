"""Repo portability policy: no git symlinks may be tracked.

Git symlinks (mode 120000) are checked out as plain text files containing the
link target on Windows clones without symlink support (`core.symlinks=false`,
the Windows default). Any code that ships or reads such a file — package data,
templates, specs — then silently consumes a path stub instead of the real
content. This broke client onboarding on Windows when the sdd_core packaged
mandate.spec/guidelines.dsl were symlinks: the wizard copied the stub and the
governance pipeline parsed zero mandates. Tracked symlinks are therefore
banned repo-wide; ship real files instead.
