## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### File Discovery:
- [ ] Use file system API to check file existence
- [ ] Use file globbing for pattern matching (ADR-*.md)
- [ ] Count matching files

### Content Validation:
- [ ] Read file contents where needed
- [ ] Parse markdown links: `\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)`
- [ ] Count total links

### Error Handling:
- [ ] Catch file not found errors
- [ ] Report specific missing files
- [ ] Continue testing other sections if possible

### Reporting:
- [ ] Report each test clearly
- [ ] Show results for each subcategory
- [ ] Provide file counts/sizes where relevant
- [ ] Summary with pass/fail count
- [ ] Exit code: 0 (≥90% pass), 1 (< 90% pass)
