# SDD Governance Projection for Devin

## Assurance disclosure

This plugin ships an embedded snapshot of SDD Harness governance skills. It has **not** verified a live SDD Harness connection for this session.

- `policy_source: embedded_snapshot`
- `assurance: reduced`
- `external_dependencies: none`

Soft/Standalone assurance is never equivalent to a connected Hard/Connected SDD Harness session. Do not represent this plugin's governance as equivalent to a live-verified SDD policy.

## Precedence order

1. Provider or organization safety controls (Devin's own permissions/config).
2. Connected SDD hard policy (not active in this profile).
3. Project canonical policy (this project's own `.sdd/`, if present).
4. Embedded SDD snapshot (this plugin's governance summary{% if include_skills %} and `skills/`{% endif %}).
5. Provider local rules (`.devin/config.json`, project `AGENTS.md`, `rules/`).
6. User task instructions.

## Skill discovery

{% if include_skills %}
Skills embedded in this plugin are listed under `skills/`. Each skill file documents its own allowed CLI commands and risk score. Do not invent commands beyond what a skill file declares. Each skill's allowed CLI assumes the `sdd` CLI is installed in this environment — if it is not, treat that skill as unavailable rather than improvising an equivalent command.
{% else %}
This build does not embed the SDD skill catalog (`include_skills=False`). No `skills/` directory is present. This plugin provides governance context only (assurance disclosure, precedence order, SDD Harness summary below) — it does not teach Devin any `sdd`-CLI-backed operations.
{% endif %}
{% if has_coding_practices %}
See `rules/sdd-coding-practices.md` for coding anti-patterns and cures (currently: universal + Go-specific).

## SDD Harness Summary (embedded snapshot)

Governance fingerprint: `{{ governance_fingerprint }}`
Workspace version: `{{ workspace_version }}`
Mandate count: `{{ mandate_count }}`
Mandates with a source description: `{{ mandate_described_count }}/{{ mandate_count }}`
Governance summary digest: `sha256:{{ governance_summary_digest }}`

This is an index, not policy text — mandate IDs and titles only. Full detail (where available in the source) is in `rules/sdd-harness-summary.md`. A general, CLI-independent behavioral ruleset is in `rules/sdd-soft-governance-behavior.md`. None of these are canonical; see `metadata/provenance.json` for the source revision this was compiled from.

Mandates:
{% for m in mandates %}
- `{{ m.id }}` — {{ m.title }}
{% endfor %}

Guideline categories:
{% for g in guideline_categories %}
- {{ g }}
{% endfor %}

## Canonical source

This plugin is a generated projection. It is **not** the canonical governance source. Canonical SDD Harness policy lives in the `.sdd/` directory of the SDD Harness project this plugin was compiled from — see `metadata/provenance.json` for the exact source revision.
