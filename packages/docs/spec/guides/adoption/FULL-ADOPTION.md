## The 16 Mandatory Rules

| # | Rule | Enforcement |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | All code in layers 1-5 must be framework-agnostic | Linting |
| 2 | All I/O must be async | Linting |
| 3 | All external deps through Ports | Code review |
| 4 | Type hints on all functions | Pre-commit |
| 5 | Docstrings for why (not what) | Pre-commit |
| 6 | ADRs for major decisions | Git hook |
| 7 | Domain tests: 100% coverage, zero mocks | CI/CD |
| 8 | UseCase tests: mock ports only | CI/CD |
| 9 | Integration tests for critical paths | CI/CD |
| 10 | No circular imports | Linting |
| 11 | No print() statements (use logging) | Linting |
| 12 | All errors mapped to HTTP status | Code review |
| 13 | Sensitive data never in logs | Security scan |
| 14 | Performance tests for bottlenecks | CI/CD |
| 15 | Runbook updated with changes | Checklist |
| 16 | Incident response documented | Checklist |

## The 7-Phase Workflow

Each feature follows 7 phases:

**Phase 0: Specification** (30 min)

- Write requirements
- Design architecture
- Identify tests needed

**Phase 1: Domain** (1-2 hours)

- Implement domain logic (pure functions, no mocks)
- Test domain 100% coverage
- No framework imports

**Phase 2: Adapters** (1-2 hours)

- Implement ports (abstract interfaces)
- Create adapters (concrete implementations)
- Test adapters independently

**Phase 3: UseCases** (1-2 hours)

- Orchestrate domain + adapters
- Implement error handling
- Test with mocked ports

**Phase 4: Integration** (1 hour)

- Integration tests with real adapters
- Test database, cache, queues
- Verify end-to-end

**Phase 5: API** (30 min)

- FastAPI controllers/routes
- Request/response validation
- Error mapping to HTTP status codes

**Phase 6: Compliance** (30 min)

- Run architecture tests
- Check all 45 DoD criteria
- Security scan
- Performance test

**Phase 7: Deployment** (Ready for merge)

- Code review approval
- CI/CD pipeline green
- Runbook updated
- Ready for production
