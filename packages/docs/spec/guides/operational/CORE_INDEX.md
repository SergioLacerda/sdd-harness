## 🚀 AGENT_HARNESS: 7 Phases

The complete development workflow:

| Phase | Duration | Document | Goal |
|-------|----------|----------|------|
| **PHASE 0** | 20-30 min | [PHASE-0-AGENT-ONBOARDING.md](.docs/spec/guides/onboarding/PHASE-0-AGENT-ONBOARDING.md) | Setup `.sdd/` infrastructure (first time only) |
| **PHASE 1** | 15 min | [AGENT_HARNESS.md](.docs/spec/guides/onboarding/AGENT_HARNESS.md#phase-1) + [constitution.md](.docs/spec/canonical/rules/constitution.md) + [ia-rules.md](.docs/spec/canonical/rules/ia-rules.md) | Lock to rules, pass VALIDATION_QUIZ (≥80%) |
| **PHASE 2** | 5 min | [AGENT_HARNESS.md](.docs/spec/guides/onboarding/AGENT_HARNESS.md#phase-2) | Check execution state for conflicts |
| **PHASE 3** | 5 min | [AGENT_HARNESS.md](.docs/spec/guides/onboarding/AGENT_HARNESS.md#phase-3) | Choose PATH (A/B/C/D) → load right docs |
| **PHASE 4** | 10-20 min | [search-keywords.md](.docs/spec/runtime/search-keywords.md) + [spec-guides-index.md](.docs/spec/runtime/spec-guides-index.md) | Load context on-demand |
| **PHASE 5** | 1-8 hours | [CANONICAL/specifications/](.docs/spec/canonical/specifications/) | Implement + tests (TDD) |
| **PHASE 6** | 10-15 min | [definition-of-done.md](.docs/spec/canonical/specifications/definition-of-done.md) | Validate (tests + quality gate) |
| **PHASE 7** | 10 min | [AGENT_HARNESS.md](.docs/spec/guides/onboarding/AGENT_HARNESS.md#phase-7) | Checkpoint + PR |
