# 🚀 PHASE 0: Agent Onboarding — Workspace Initialization

**For:** AI Agents starting work on SPEC projects
**Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Goal:** Create project infrastructure + validate SDD adoption
**Requires:** Read `.spec.config` first

---

## 📋 PHASE 0 Overview

**What happens here:**

1. Agent discovers spec-architecture via `.spec.config`
2. Agent creates `.sdd/context-aware/` infrastructure
3. Agent takes SDD validation quiz (≥80% required)
4. Agent confirms workspace is ready
5. Agent proceeds to actual work tasks

**Why:** Each project starts with zero context. Agent must bootstrap it locally.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Read Seed Configuration

### 1.1 Find `.spec.config`

```bash
# You're in a new project. First file to check:
cat .spec.config
```

**Expected output:**

```ini
[spec]
spec_path = ../spec-architecture
min_version = 2.1
```

**Agent validates:**

- ✅ `.spec.config` exists
- ✅ `spec_path` points to valid directory
- ✅ Framework version matches

### 1.2 Verify Framework Location

```bash
# Navigate to SPEC framework
SPEC_PATH=$(grep spec_path .spec.config | cut -d' ' -f3)
cd $SPEC_PATH

# Verify key directories exist
ls EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md
ls EXECUTION/spec/indices/
ls templates/
```

**Agent validates:**

- ✅ `/EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/` exists
- ✅ `EXECUTION/spec/indices/` exists (framework index templates)
- ✅ `templates/` exists (to copy from)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create Project Infrastructure

### 2.1 Create Directories

```bash
# Return to project root
cd -

# Create .ai folder structure
mkdir -p .sdd/context-aware/{task-progress/completed,analysis,runtime-state}

# Create other required directories if not present
mkdir -p tests/unit/specs_ia_units
mkdir -p .github .vscode
```

### 2.2 Copy Infrastructure Templates from SPEC

```bash
# Get SPEC path from config
SPEC_PATH=$(grep spec_path .spec.config | cut -d' ' -f3)

# Copy context-aware template
cp $SPEC_PATH/templates/ai/context-aware/README.md \
   .sdd/context-aware/README.md

# Copy task-progress template
cp $SPEC_PATH/templates/ai/context-aware/task-progress/_current.md \
   .sdd/context-aware/task-progress/_current.md

# Copy analysis template
cp $SPEC_PATH/templates/ai/context-aware/analysis/_template.md \
   .sdd/context-aware/analysis/_current-issues.md

# Copy runtime-state template
cp $SPEC_PATH/templates/ai/context-aware/runtime-state/_current.md \
   .sdd/context-aware/runtime-state/_current.md
```

### 2.3 Verify Structure

```bash
# Check that all files exist
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/task-progress/
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/analysis/
ls -la .sdd/context-aware/runtime-state/

# Verify README exists
cat .sdd/context-aware/README.md | head -20
```

**Agent validates:**

- ✅ All directories created
- ✅ All template files copied
- ✅ Files are readable

---

## ✅ Step 3: Read SPEC Documentation

### 3.1 Read Rules (MANDATORY)

Before writing any code, understand the rules:

```bash
# Get SPEC path
SPEC_PATH=$(grep spec_path .spec.config | cut -d' ' -f3)

# Read the rules
cat $SPEC_PATH/EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md | head -100
```

**Key concepts to understand:**

1. **Source of Truth Priority** — constitution.md > ia-rules.md
2. **Thread Isolation** — Never modify other threads
3. **Checkpointing** — Update execution-state after features
4. **Ports** — Never bypass, always use abstractions
5. **Gap Documentation** — Real ≠ Docs is normal

**Agent validates:**

- ✅ Can read ia-rules.md from SPEC
- ✅ Understands 5 core concepts above

### 3.2 Read Context-Aware Pattern

```bash
# Read how agents organize dynamic context (canonical specification)
cat $SPEC_PATH/EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/specifications/context-aware-agent-pattern.md | head -150
```

**Agent validates:**

- ✅ Understands context-aware pattern
- ✅ Knows how to track task-progress
- ✅ Knows how to document analysis
- ✅ Knows how to update runtime-state

---

## ✅ Step 4: Validation Quiz (MANDATORY)

### 4.1 Take Quiz

```bash
# Get SPEC path
SPEC_PATH=$(grep spec_path .spec.config | cut -d' ' -f3)

# Read quiz
cat $SPEC_PATHdocs/spec/guides/onboarding/VALIDATION_QUIZ.md
```

**Quiz structure (5 questions):**

1. What is source of truth priority?
2. What is thread isolation?
3. What is checkpointing?
4. What are ports?
5. What is gap documentation?

### 4.2 Score Yourself

```
Score: ___ / 5 (need ≥ 4 to pass, 80%)
```

### 4.3 Conditional Proceed

**If Score ≥ 4 (80%):**

```bash
echo "✅ QUIZ PASSED - Proceeding to workspace validation"
```

**If Score < 4:**

```bash
echo "❌ QUIZ FAILED - Review ia-rules.md again and retry"
# Re-read ia-rules.md
cat $SPEC_PATH/EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md
# Wait 30 minutes
# Retake quiz
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Workspace Validation

### 5.1 Update Project Metadata

Edit `.sdd/context-aware/task-progress/_current.md`:

```markdown
# Task Progress — [Today's Date]

## PHASE 0: Agent Onboarding

### Task: Initialize Workspace
- **Status:** 🟢 IN PROGRESS
- **Agent:** [Your Name]

## 🔄 If Something Fails

### Problem: Can't find spec-architecture

```bash
# Manually edit .spec.config with correct path
vi .spec.config
# Change spec_path to valid location

# Verify
cat .spec.config | grep spec_path
```

### Problem: Quiz failed

```bash
# Re-read rules carefully
SPEC_PATH=$(grep spec_path .spec.config | cut -d' ' -f3)
cat $SPEC_PATH/EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md

# Wait 30 minutes
# Retake quiz
```

### Problem: Can't create directories

```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la .

# Create manually if needed
mkdir -p .sdd/context-aware/{task-progress/completed,analysis,runtime-state}

# Verify
ls -la .sdd/
```

## 📚 What You Now Know (After PHASE 0)

You understand:

✅ **Where SPEC is** (.spec.config points to it)
✅ **What the rules are** (ia-rules.md)
✅ **How to use context-aware** (runtime guides)
✅ **What infrastructure is created** (.sdd/context-aware/)
✅ **Why SDD matters** (validation quiz passed)

---

## 🎯 Ready to Start Work?

**Yes! You're now ready for real tasks:**

1. Read project SPECIALIZATIONS (project-specific patterns)
2. Check execution-state/_current.md (avoid conflicts)
3. Choose your PATH (A/B/C/D from AGENT_HARNESS)
4. Load relevant context for that PATH
5. Begin implementation

**Time elapsed:** ~30 minutes
**Value created:** Project infrastructure initialized + knowledge validated
**Confidence level:** 100% (you followed the protocol)

---

## 📋 PHASE 0 Completion Certificate
