## Runbook Consultation

Use `docs/runbooks/README.md` as a selective index when a task involves
operational failure, diagnosis, hotfix, repeated failure, release recovery,
generated-runtime drift, or context-budget breach.

The context router must load at most one matching runbook leaf unless the task
explicitly requires cross-runbook comparison. Record why the selected runbook is
relevant before loading it. If no runbook matches an active incident, use
`docs/incidents/PLAYBOOKS.md` as the fallback operational procedure.
