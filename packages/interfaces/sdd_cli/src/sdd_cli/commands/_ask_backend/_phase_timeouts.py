"""Default per-phase watchdog thresholds for `sdd ask` (design.md §3, T-04).

Values are derived from real, locally observed data rather than guessed:

- `ask.budget.guard`, `ask.workspace.resolve`, `ask.organize.intake`,
  `ask.handshake.guard`, `ask.profile.resolve` — sampled at 0-2ms from
  real `governance.ask.phase` events in this workspace's own
  `.sdd/runtime/compliance-events.jsonl` (62 prior `sdd ask` invocations,
  372 phase events). Given a 100ms threshold (~50-100x observed median).
- `ask.governance.snapshot` — the dominant phase, sampled at ~9-20ms with a
  warm cache in the same JSONL sample. No cold-cache-miss (disk reload +
  signature verification) sample was available locally, so the threshold
  carries a wider margin (2000ms, ~100x the warm-cache median) rather than
  a tight bound, to avoid false-positive warnings on a legitimate cold
  cache.
- `ask.runtime.handbook` — newly split out of what was previously folded
  into `ask.governance.snapshot`'s timing; no isolated sample exists yet,
  so it inherits a proportionally generous threshold (300ms).
- `ask.cli.entry`, `ask.response.render`, `ask.telemetry.emit` — new
  phases with no prior samples (they did not exist before this mission);
  thresholds are set as a generous multiple of what similarly
  lightweight, non-I/O phases measure above, not a tight bound.
- `ask.external.llm_exchange` — deliberately excluded from the tight
  defaults: this phase measures adapter-reported LLM inference latency,
  which is expected to legitimately take seconds. A low threshold here
  would produce constant false-positive "slow" warnings for normal LLM
  latency, defeating the diagnostic purpose of the watchdog.

`tests/perf/benchmark_ask_cold_invocation.py`'s existing benchmark
(`tests/perf/benchmark_ask_cold_invocation_results.json`) measures only
whole-process wall time (subprocess start + interpreter import + full call,
p50 ~479-494ms, p95 ~502-649ms as of 2026-07-30), not per-phase timing, so
it could not directly seed these per-phase values — the JSONL sample above
is the only available per-phase source.

These are starting defaults, not hard-coded policy: overriding
`thresholds_ms/default_threshold_ms` on a `PhaseTimer` instance replaces
them per call site.
