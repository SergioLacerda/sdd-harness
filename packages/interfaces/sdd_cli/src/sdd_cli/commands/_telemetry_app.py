"""Shared `app` instance and events-path resolution for the `telemetry` group.

Exists solely to break the import cycle between `telemetry.py` and
`telemetry_query.py` (T13 split): both files need the same Typer `app` to
attach commands to, and both need the events-path resolution helpers below.
If either imported the other directly, one would have to be imported before
it finishes defining `app` — the exact shape flagged by CodeQL's
cyclic-import query, and also flagged by
`tools/architecture/validate_cycles.py`, which does not distinguish deferred
(function-local) imports from module-level ones — any textual
cross-reference between the two files counts as a cycle edge to that
checker. Both files now depend one-way on this module instead of on each
other.
