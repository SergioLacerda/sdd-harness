    the write is now atomic (temp file + `os.replace`) so an interrupted
    write never leaves a partially written JSON file for the next reader.

    When `changed_keys` is given, the write is also concurrency-safe across
    processes, held under an exclusive interprocess lock, using an
    optimistic-concurrency check (the finding's own "comparação de versão"
    option) rather than an unconditional re-read: if the file's mtime still
    matches what `_load_governance_state` observed, nothing else has
    written since, so `data` is still accurate and is written as-is — no
    extra disk read, preserving design.md D-01's one-read-per-call
    guarantee in the common (uncontended) case. Only when the mtime has
    moved (a concurrent process wrote in between) does this re-read the
    file fresh and merge just the named top-level keys from `data` onto
    it — every other top-level key then comes from that fresh read, not
    from `data`'s stale copy. Without `changed_keys` (back-compat default),
    the full `data` dict is written as-is unconditionally — callers that
    read-mutate-write the whole blob without declaring which keys they
    actually changed keep the pre-existing behavior, still gaining the
    atomic-write guarantee.
