# Quick Reference: SDD Governance

**Quick Lookup Table for AI Agents & Developers**

## Common Tasks

| Task | Command | Expected Output |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Check governance status | `python packages/agent_handshake.py --mode=compact` | 🟢 HEALTHY (if adopted) |
| Initialize governance | `python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py` | Wizard walks you through setup |
| List governance policies | `cat .sdd/governance-core.json` | JSON config |
| Check authority roles | `grep -A5 '"authority"' .sdd/governance-core.json` | Lists architect, governance, ops |
| Validate compliance | `python packages/quiz_executor.py --topic=governance` | Score + topic breakdown |
| View seedlings | `ls -la .sdd/seedlings/` | List of active domains |
| Update enforcement | Edit `.sdd/governance-core.json` → set `"enforcement": "strict"` | Blocks bypasses |

## Health Check States

| State | Symbol | Meaning | Next Action |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| HEALTHY | 🟢 | Governance fully adopted | Proceed with work |
| PARTIAL | 🟡 | Governance incomplete | Complete setup steps |
| NOT_INITIALIZED | ⚠️ | PHASE 0 not run | `python phase-0-agent-onboarding.py` |
| MISCONFIGURED | ⚠️ | Governance files broken | Fix .sdd/governance-core.json |
| NOT_CONNECTED | ❌ | No governance found | Initialize with wizard |

## AI Agent Decision Tree

```
User asks about governance?
├─ Yes, wants to ADOPT
│  └─ → Send to WIZARD_ADOPTION.md
│     └─ Recommend: python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py
│
├─ Yes, wants to IMPLEMENT
│  └─ → Send to GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
│     └─ Show structure & step-by-step
│
├─ Yes, wants to ENFORCE
│  └─ → Send to ENFORCEMENT_GUIDE.md
│     └─ Enable strict mode + manual bypass disabled
│
└─ Yes, needs QUICK_REFERENCE

## Enforcement Levels

| Level | Strictness | Bypass Allowed | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|---|---|
| `strict` | 🔒 Maximum | No | Production, critical systems |
| `standard` | 🔐 Moderate | Only by architect | Most projects |
| `permissive` | 🔓 Low | Anyone can override | Dev/experimental |

Set in `governance-core.json`:
```json
"policies": {
  "enforcement": "strict"
}
```

## Quick Setup (5 min)

```bash
# 1. Run wizard (interactive, ~3 min)
python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py

# 2. Verify governance created
ls -la .sdd/governance-core.json

# 3. Validate with health check
python packages/agent_handshake.py --mode=compact

# 4. If healthy, you're done!
# 🟢 HEALTHY → ready for PHASE 1
```

## Error Messages & Fixes

### ❌ "governance-core.json not found"
**Fix:** Run wizard: `python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py`

### ❌ "Governance files not valid JSON"
**Fix:** `python3 -m json.tool .sdd/governance-core.json` to find errors, fix them

### ❌ "Authority not recognized"
**Fix:** Add your email to `authority` section in governance-core.json

### ❌ "Manual bypass blocked"
**Fix:** Change `"manual_bypass_allowed": true` if you need override (not recommended)

### ❌ "Phase progression blocked"
**Fix:** Update `"phases"."current"` in governance-core.json to match progress

## Integration Points

### With Agent Handshake Protocol (AHP)
- AHP Layer 4 validates governance compliance
- If governance enforcement="strict", AHP blocks non-compliant operations
- Semantic trigger: "governance", "policy", "compliance" keywords

### With Quiz System
- Topic: governance (3 questions)
- Tests understanding of policies, authority, seedlings
- Pass 70% to confirm knowledge

### With Wizard
- PHASE 0 creates initial governance structure
- Wizard walks through all setup steps
- Output validated by AHP

## Authority Roles Explained

| Role | Permission | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `architect` | Modify policies, create seedlings, deploy | Jane (lead architect) |
| `governance` | Enforce rules, approve changes | Bob (governance lead) |
| `operations` | Deploy to production, manage runtime | Alice (ops engineer) |

Add users to roles in governance-core.json:
```json
"authority": {
  "architect": ["jane@company.com"],
  "governance": ["bob@company.com"],
  "operations": ["alice@company.com"]
}
```

## Checklist: Is Governance Adopted?

- [ ] `.sdd/governance-core.json` exists
- [ ] `.sdd/seedlings/` has at least one domain
- [ ] Authority roles assigned
- [ ] Enforcement level set (strict/standard/permissive)
- [ ] AHP reports HEALTHY status
- [ ] Quiz passes (governance topic)
- [ ] Phase 0 marked complete

If all checked: **Governance is adopted!** ✅
