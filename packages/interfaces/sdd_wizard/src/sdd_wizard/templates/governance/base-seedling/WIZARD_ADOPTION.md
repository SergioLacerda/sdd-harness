# Wizard Integration for Governance Adoption

**Audience**: AI Agents Guiding Users Through PHASE 0 Onboarding
**Purpose**: Help users adopt SDD Architecture governance via the wizard
**Status**: Optimized for Semantic Detection & Automation

---

## What is Wizard Integration?

The SDD wizard (`EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py`) guides users through:
1. **Governance Structure Setup** - Initialize `.sdd/` directory
2. **Policy Configuration** - Define authority rules
3. **Seedling Templates** - Select domain patterns
4. **Validation** - Ensure everything works

This document explains how to help users complete these steps.

## 🎯 For AI Agents: Question/Response Patterns

### Pattern 1: User Doesn't Know About Wizard

```
User: "How do I set up SDD Architecture?"
AI: "Great! The fastest way is through the wizard. Let me guide you:

1. Run this command:
   python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py

2. Answer these questions:
   - What's your domain? (e.g., 'rpg-narrative-server')
   - What's the language? (python/js/java)
   - Do you want strict governance? (yes/no)

3. The wizard will create everything:
   ✓ .sdd/ directory structure
   ✓ governance-core.json config
   ✓ Seedling templates
   ✓ Health checks ready to run

Then verify:
   python packages/agent_handshake.py --mode=compact"
```

### Pattern 2: User Wants to Understand Steps

```
User: "What does the wizard actually do?"
AI: "The wizard (phase-0-agent-onboarding) does 5 things:

PHASE 0a - Discovery
  • Detects your current project structure
  • Identifies available templates
  • Suggests domain-specific seedlings

PHASE 0b - Configuration
  • Creates .sdd/ directory
  • Generates governance-core.json
  • Sets up authority definitions

PHASE 0c - Template Selection
  • Shows available seedlings
  • Lets user customize
  • Applies selections

PHASE 0d - Validation
  • Runs health checks
  • Verifies all files created
  • Reports any issues

PHASE 0e - Documentation
  • Generates README
  • Shows next steps
  • Links to full guides"
```

### Pattern 3: User Hits an Error

```
User: "The wizard failed at governance setup"
AI: "Let me help you fix this. The wizard validation failed.

Check these in order:
1. Is .sdd/ directory writable?
   ls -la .sdd/

2. Is governance-core.json valid JSON?
   python3 -m json.tool .sdd/governance-core.json

3. Are all required fields present?
   See: adoption-rules/MANDATORY_POLICIES.md

Common fixes:
   • Re-run wizard: python EXECUTION/SCRIPTS/phase-0-agent-onboarding.py
   • Manual fix: See GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   • Full reset: rm -rf .sdd/ && run wizard again"
```

## 📋 Governance Setup Flow (For Agents)

### What the Wizard Creates

```
.sdd/
├── governance-core.json          ← Authority definitions
├── seedlings/                     ← Domain templates
│   ├── {user-domain}/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── governance-specialization.json
│   │   └── implementation/
│   └── {other-domains}/
├── phases/                        ← Operational phases
│   ├── PHASE_0_ENTRY.json
│   ├── PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.json
│   └── ...PHASE_7_DELIVERY.json
└── enforcement/                   ← Rule validation
    ├── mandatory-rules.json
    └── adoption-checklist.json
```

### What Users Need to Know

**Before Running Wizard:**
- Current directory is their project root
- They have git initialized
- They understand their domain

**After Running Wizard:**
- .sdd/ is fully configured
- They can run health checks
- They're ready for implementation

## 🔗 Integration with Agent Handshake Protocol

The wizard output is **validated by AHP** (Agent Handshake Protocol):

```python
# After wizard completes, AHP validates:
python packages/agent_handshake.py --mode=compact

Expected output:
  🟢 HEALTHY - All governance files created
  ✓ .sdd/governance-core.json detected
  ✓ Authority definitions valid
  ✓ Seedling structure initialized
  ✓ Ready for PHASE 1
```

If AHP shows ❌ NOT_CONNECTED:
1. Wizard didn't complete successfully
2. Files were moved or deleted
3. Manual intervention needed

**AI Agent Action:**
Guide user to adoption-rules/ENFORCEMENT_GUIDE.md to fix.
