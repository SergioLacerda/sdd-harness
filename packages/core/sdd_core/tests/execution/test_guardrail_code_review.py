"""
Test Suite: CODE REVIEW Guardrail (ADR-008)

Purpose: Ensure agent NEVER auto-commits, all changes require architect review.
This is CRITICAL between v2.1 → v3.1-beta.1 → v3.0 to prevent broken versions.

Tests verify:
  1. Agent cannot force-push to main
  2. Agent cannot auto-merge to main
  3. Agent must use WIP branch + PR workflow
  4. Architect approval required before ANY main commit
  5. Critical files protected (ADRs, mandates, DECISIONS.md)
  6. Rollback capability preserved
