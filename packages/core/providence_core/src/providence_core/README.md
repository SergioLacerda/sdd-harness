# 📚 EXECUTION — AGENT_HARNESS Development Workflow

**For:** Developers/agents developing features on projects using SDD framework
**Duration:** 40 minutes (PHASE 0) + ongoing work
**Complexity:** 7 clear phases, each with own entry point
**Outcome:** Feature implemented, tests passing, checkpoint documented

---

## 🎯 What is Execution?

Execution = using SDD framework to implement work (features, bugs, improvements).

The workflow is **AGENT_HARNESS: 7 Phases**

1. **PHASE 1:** Lock to Rules (read constitution, pass quiz)
2. **PHASE 2:** Check Execution State (detect conflicts)
3. **PHASE 3:** Choose PATH (A=bug, B=simple feature, C=complex, D=multithread)
4. **PHASE 4:** Load Context (from SDD, on-demand)
5. **PHASE 5:** Implement (with TDD, track in .sdd/)
6. **PHASE 6:** Validate (tests pass, definition of done)
7. **PHASE 7:** Checkpoint (update state, create PR)

---

## 🚀 Execution Workflow

```
Start: You have a task to implement
  ↓
[PHASE 1] Read: constitution.md + ia-rules.md
          Pass: VALIDATION_QUIZ (≥80%)
  ↓
[PHASE 2] Check: .sdd/context-aware/ for conflicts
  ↓
[PHASE 3] Choose: PATH A/B/C/D (load right docs)
  ↓
[PHASE 4] Search: .sdd/runtime/search-keywords.md
          Load: docs you need (on-demand)
  ↓
[PHASE 5] Implement: Feature + tests (TDD)
          Track: in .sdd/context-aware/task-progress/
  ↓
[PHASE 6] Run: Tests, check definition_of_done
          Update: .sdd/context-aware/analysis/
  ↓
[PHASE 7] Checkpoint: Document decisions + risks
          Create: PR with checkpoint info
  ↓
End: Feature complete, ready for review
```
