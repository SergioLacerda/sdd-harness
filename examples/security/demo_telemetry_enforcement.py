SDD Security Demo — Telemetry Sink Enforcement (M007 / M009)

Shows two complementary telemetry enforcement patterns:

  1. AlertDispatcher — routes breach/cap events to a webhook endpoint,
     demonstrating that governance violations are observable externally.
     An operation that fires without a sink is "dark" (unauditable).

  2. TelemetrySink — captures all RuntimeEvents in-process (JSONL).
     Demonstrates that governance-sensitive calls (budget breach, retry cap)
     are recorded before any remediation path.

In production, operating without a configured sink violates M007
(Telemetry Enforcement) and M009 (OpenTelemetry Compliance).
