SDD Security Demo — Session Drift Scoring (PATH Overload Detection)

Shows SDD's entropy-based drift scorer detecting when an agent is
systematically overloading complex PATHs (C/D) instead of decomposing
work. This is a governance signal — not a binary mismatch, but a
gradual drift score derived from session history.

PATHs defined in §economy/efficiency-policy.md:
  A = simple task (≤ 2 retries, ≤ 1 reflection)
  B = moderate task (≤ 3 retries, ≤ 2 reflections)
  C = complex feature (counted against overload threshold)
  D = multi-thread task (counted against overload threshold)

Overload condition: PATH C or D > 50% of all tasks.

Run from repo root:
    uv run python examples/security/demo_session_drift_scoring.py
